# Introducing Concurrency

→  We are going to deal with the topic of asynchronous code and some options for multitasking with code. This concept is called concurrency

→ This is programming in JavaScript at a high level
      
→ Yes, this is tough, but understanding how to leverage concurrency can really enhance the performance of your program by speeding up the process

→ Concurrency is whenever things are happening "at the same time" or in parallel

→ Example:

    We can do a call to some API and not wait for the reply but do something useful in the meantime instead

→ Three Strategies in JS for Concurrency:

    1) callbacks
    2) Promises
    3) async/await keywords
