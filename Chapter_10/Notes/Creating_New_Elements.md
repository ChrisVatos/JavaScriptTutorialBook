# Creating New Elements

→ Creation of new elements and adding them to the DOM involves two steps: 

    1) Creating the element

    2) Adding it to the DOM

## Creating Elements

→ To create a new elements, use the createElement() method

    → Syntax: document.createElement(elementName)

            → elementName = type of HTML element we want to create

## Adding Elements

→ To add elements to the DOM, use the appendChild() method

    → Syntax: elementToAppendTo.appendChild(element)

        → element = element we want to add to the DOM

    → This method adds an element as the new last child of the parent element
