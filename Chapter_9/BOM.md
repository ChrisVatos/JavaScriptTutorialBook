# Browser Object Model (BOM)

→ Also called the window browser object

→  Makes it possible for JS code to communicate with the browser

→ Contains all the properties required to represent the window of the browser

    → The size of the window 
    
    → The history of previously visited web pages
    
→ The window object has global variables and functions, and these can all be seen when we explore the window object

→ The exact implementation of the BOM depends on the browser and the version of the browser
