→ The Document Object Model (DOM) grabs an HTML page and turns it into a logical tree.

    → DOM contains all the HTML elements on a page.

    → With JS, we can select and manipulate parts of the DOM.

→ The Browser Object Model (BOM) holds all the methods and properties for JS to interact with the browser


## HTML Crash Course

    → Open: <elementName>
    → Close: </elementName>
