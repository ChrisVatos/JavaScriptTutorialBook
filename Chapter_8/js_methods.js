/* Built-In JavaScript Methods --> Functionality that we get out of the box with JS
                               --> Use methods that we haven't coded ourselves
                               --> Difference between a function and a method is that a function is defined anywhere within
                                   the script whereas a method is defined within a class
                               --> Methods are essentially functions on classes and instances  */
