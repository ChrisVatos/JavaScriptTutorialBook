# Form Submission

→ When a form is submitted, an event can be triggered

→ One way to do this is to add the "onsubmit" attribute to the form element: 

    → <form onsubmit = "doSomething()>

→ The function that is listed there will get triggered whenever input of type submit is submitted:

    → <input type="submit" value="send">
